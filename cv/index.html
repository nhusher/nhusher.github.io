            Faraday provides AI-driven data science for companies that can't or
            don't want to set up their own in-house data science group. They use
            a flexible infrastructure to apply artificial intelligence to
            different business problems, from generating marketing lists to
            recommending the locations of new storefronts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked in various intermittent capacities for Faraday
            since 2015, taking a full-time role as Frontend Lead in late 2020.
            As a small startup looking for a niche in the market, my role is
            multifaceted. My main responsibility is improving their self-service
            market analysis web application. I'm also involved in database
            design discussions, data security, and continuous integration.
          </p>
          <h4>Selected projects</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Migrated a 30,000-line frontend application from Angular 1.x to
              React. This reduced the number of state-related bugs in the UI
              by embracing data immutability and functional programming styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Converted build tooling from Grunt/Gulp to Webpack, which opened
              up better ways to compose code artefacts together. JS, CSS,
              images. With webpack, assets could be split/combined as the use
              case demanded, just by updating some configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a new GraphQL API service from the ground up to better
              serve the UI. This had the knock-on effect of reducing the amount
              of manually-managed state in the frontend app, reducing the
              surface area of state-related bugs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Instituted strict security policies in the app. Content security
              policy headers, in particular, reduce the ability for malicious
              code to exfiltrate sensitive PII or HIPAA-protected data from
              the frontend.

            Indigo Agriculture is trying to improve the market for commodity
            grain. This takes two main forms: first, they offer an organic
            microbial seed treatment that can improve crop yields by incresing
            drought tolerance and pest resistance; and second, by offering an
            online marketplace for farmers to sell their crops directly to
            food companies, rather than selling to grain clearing houses.
          </p>
          <h4>Selected projects</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Was the technical lead on a React Native version of Indigo's
              Marketplace application. The React Native Marketplace was
              designed to load faster and work better in areas with poor
              internet accesss&mdash;like in the seat of a tractor in a
              midwestern corn field.
            </li>
            <li>
              I led a team to do architectural cleanup and developer experience
              improvements. For example, we migrated across a couple major
              Apollo Client versions, eliminated several common frontend
              failure cases, reduced build times on our CI server, and cut out
              unused legacy code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked on a team of staff engineers to build an accessible,
              consistent, forward-looking component library for building user
              interfaces at Indigo. Part of this migration was deprecating
              buggy and heavyweight material-ui components in favor of
              home-grown implementations.

            Lola Travel was a startup that that built lightweight, user-focused
            travel software for small businesses.
          </p>
          <h4>Selected projects</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Worked on a team to build the first iteration of Lola's mobile
              application, built in React Native. The focus of the app was
              low-friction signup and use, coupled with an AI-driven hotel
              recommendation algorithm. I implemented a cross-platform form
              focus management system, because focus management was poorly
              defined in React Native at the time.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was the technical lead on a web application that let admins
              at a small business set booking criteria, which would inform
              which hotels, flights, and car rentals would appear in the
              mobile app. This project went through many iterations and
              pivots as the startup attempted to find product-market fit.

            Pwnie Express provided vulnerability and threat detection software.
            They used custom-designed sensors to detect devices connected to a
            network, and wireless devices that are adjacent to the network,
            like cell phones, bluetooth devices, wireless printers, or credit
            card skimmers. These devices were categorized and indexed in a
            cloud-based database, which could be queried and navigated from a
            browser-based webapp.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job was threefold: I worked with other developers to implement
            new features that users and prospective clients want, that would
            drive engagement on the platform; I lead an application-wide effort
            to migrate the project from a legacy Ember implementation to one
            written in React, with more modern and functional sensibilities;
            And finally, I provided user experience leadership in an
            environment where there were many talented engineers, support
            reps, and salespeople, but no designers.
