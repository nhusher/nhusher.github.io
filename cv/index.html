            Faraday provides AI-driven data science for companies that can't or
            don't want to set up their own in-house data science group. They use
            a flexible infrastructure to apply artificial intelligence to
            different business problems, from generating marketing lists to
            recommending the locations of new storefronts.

            As a small startup looking for a niche in the market, my role is
            multifaceted. My main responsibility is improving their self-service
            market analysis web application. I'm also involved in database
            design discussions, data security, and continuous integration.

            Indigo Agriculture is trying to improve the market for commodity
            grain. This takes two main forms: first, they offer an organic
            microbial seed treatment that can improve crop yields by incresing
            drought tolerance and pest resistance; and second, by offering an
            online marketplace for farmers to sell their crops directly to
            food companies, rather than selling to grain clearing houses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on a few different projects while at Indigo: The first
            was a React Native version of the Indigo marketplace application,
            designed to load faster and work better in areas with poor cellular
            data availability; The second was leading a team to do
            architectural cleanup of some low-level code in the Marketplace UI
            application, which was dragging down developer productivity;
            Finally, I worked on a team to provide an accessible, consistent,
            and forward-looking UI component library for Indigo web
            applications.

          <p>
            My role was to provide technical leadership and support on three 
            React-based projects: A React Native mobile app that can be used to
            book hotels and flights, a React web application that travel 
            administrators within a company may use to track and manage
            business trips that employees have booked, and a web application
            that Lola agents use to provide support to the other two apps,
            served by a GraphQL endpoint.

          <p>
            Pwnie Express provided vulnerability and threat detection software.
            They used custom-designed sensors to detect devices connected to a
            network, and wireless devices that are adjacent to the network,
            like cell phones, bluetooth devices, wireless printers, or credit
            card skimmers. These devices were categorized and indexed in a
            cloud-based database, which could be queried and navigated from a
            browser-based webapp.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job was threefold: I worked with other developers to implement
            new features that users and prospective clients want, that would
            drive engagement on the platform; I lead an application-wide effort
            to migrate the project from a legacy Ember implementation to one
            written in React, with more modern and functional sensibilities;
            And finally, I provided user experience leadership in an
            environment where there were many talented engineers, support
            reps, and salespeople, but no designers.
